It can also be defined as a rectangle in which two adjacent sides have equal length. A square with vertices ABCD would be denoted ◻ ABCD.</p><h2 id=price>Price</h2><p>The square is priced at <code>$4
</code>.</p><h2 id=characterizations>Characterizations</h2><p>A convex quadrilateral is a square if and only if it is any one of the following</p><ul><li>a rectangle with two adjacent equal sides</li><li>a rhombus with a right vertex angle</li><li>a rhombus with all angles equal</li><li>a parallelogram with one right vertex angle and two adjacent equal sides</li><li>a quadrilateral with four equal sides and four right angles</li><li>a quadrilateral where the diagonals are equal and are the perpendicular bisectors of each other, i.e. a rhombus with equal diagonals</li><li>a convex quadrilateral with successive sides a, b, c, d whose area is A = 1/2(a<sup>2</sup> + c<sup>2</sup>) = 1/2(b<sup>2</sup> + d<sup>2</sup>)</li></ul><h2 id=properties>Properties</h2><p>A square is a special case of a rhombus (equal sides, opposite equal angles), a kite (two pairs of adjacent equal sides), a trapezoid (one pair of opposite sides parallel), a parallelogram (all opposite sides parallel), a quadrilateral or tetragon (four-sided polygon), and a rectangle (opposite sides equal, right-angles) and therefore has all the properties of all these shapes, namely:</p><ul><li>The diagonals of a square bisect each other and meet at 90°</li><li>The diagonals of a square bisect its angles.</li><li>Opposite sides of a square are both parallel and equal in length.</li><li>All four angles of a square are equal. (Each is 360°/4 = 90°, so every angle of a square is a right angle.)</li><li>All four sides of a square are equal.</li><li>The diagonals of a square are equal.</li><li>The square is the n=2 case of the families of n-hypercubes and n-orthoplexes.</li><li>A square has Schläfli symbol. A truncated square, t, is an octagon. An alternated square, h, is a digon.</li></ul><h2 id=other-facts>Other facts</h2><ul><li>A square can also be defined as a parallelogram with equal diagonals that bisect the angles.</li><li>If a figure is both a rectangle (right angles) and a rhombus (equal edge lengths), then it is a square.</li><li>If a circle is circumscribed around a square, the area of the circle is π / 2 (about 1.5708) times the area of the square.</li><li>If a circle is inscribed in the square, the area of the circle is π / 4 (about 0.7854) times the area of the square.</li><li>A square has a larger area than any other quadrilateral with the same perimeter.</li><li>A square tiling is one of three regular tilings of the plane (the others are the equilateral triangle and the regular hexagon).</li><li>The square is in two families of polytopes in two dimensions: hypercube and the cross-polytope.</li><li>The square is a highly symmetric object. There are four lines of reflectional symmetry and it has rotational symmetry of order 4 (through 90°, 180° and 270°). Its symmetry group is the dihedral group D4.</li></ul><p>Content from <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square>wikipedia</a></p><div class=comments><h3>Comments</h3><template id=comment-success><div class=success>Your comment has been successfully submitted for moderation.

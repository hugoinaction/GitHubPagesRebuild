The cutting edge serves to separate chip from the parent work material. Connected to the cutting edge are the two surfaces of the tool:\n The rake face; and The flank.  The rake face which directs the flow of newly formed chip, is oriented at a certain angle is called the rake angle \u0026ldquo;Œ±\u0026rdquo;. It is measured relative to the plane perpendicular to the work surface. The rake angle can be positive or negative. The flank of the tool provides a clearance between the tool and the newly formed work surface, thus protecting the surface from abrasion, which would degrade the finish. This angle between the work surface and the flank surface is called the relief angle. There are two basic types of cutting tools:\n Single point tool; and Multiple-cutting-edge tool  A single point tool has one cutting edge and is used for turning, boring and planing. During machining, the point of the tool penetrates below the original work surface of the workpart. The point is sometimes rounded to a certain radius, called the nose radius.\nMultiple-cutting-edge tools have more than one cutting edge and usually achieve their motion relative to the workpart by rotating. Drilling and milling uses rotating multiple-cutting-edge tools. Although the shapes of these tools are different from a single-point tool, many elements of tool geometry are similar.\nContent from wikipedia.\n","tags":null,"title":"Our Manufacturing Process Part IV","url":"/GitHubPagesRebuild/blog/process-4/"},{"content":"Machining is any process in which a cutting tool is used to remove small chips of material from the workpiece (the workpiece is often called the \u0026ldquo;work\u0026rdquo;). To perform the operation, relative motion is required between the tool and the work. This relative motion is achieved in most machining operation by means of a primary motion, called \u0026ldquo;cutting speed\u0026rdquo; and a secondary motion called \u0026ldquo;feed\u0026rdquo;.[7] The shape of the tool and its penetration into the work surface, combined with these motions, produce the desired shape of the resulting work surface.\nMachining operations There are many kinds of machining operations, each of which is capable of generating a certain part geometry and surface texture.\nIn turning, a cutting tool with a single cutting edge is used to remove material from a rotating workpiece to generate a cylindrical shape. The primary motion is provided by rotating the workpiece, and the feed motion is achieved by moving the cutting tool slowly in a direction parallel to the axis of rotation of the workpiece.\nDrilling is used to create a round hole. It is accomplished by a rotating tool that typically has two or four helical cutting edges. The tool is fed in a direction parallel to its axis of rotation into the workpiece to form the round hole.\nIn boring, a tool with a single bent pointed tip is advanced into a roughly made hole in a spinning workpiece to slightly enlarge the hole and improve its accuracy. It is a fine finishing operation used in the final stages of product manufacture.\nReaming is one of the sizing operations that removes a small amount of metal from a hole already drilled.\nIn milling, a rotating tool with multiple cutting edges is moved slowly relative to the material to generate a plane or straight surface. The direction of the feed motion is perpendicular to the tool\u0026rsquo;s axis of rotation. The speed motion is provided by the rotating milling cutter. The two basic forms of milling are:\n Peripheral milling Face milling.  Other conventional machining operations include shaping, planing, broaching and sawing. Also, grinding and similar abrasive operations are often included within the category of machining.\nContent from wikipedia.\n","tags":["manufacturing"],"title":"Our Manufacturing Process Part III","url":"/GitHubPagesRebuild/blog/process-3/"},{"content":"The three principal machining processes are classified as turning, drilling and milling. Other operations falling into miscellaneous categories include shaping, planing, boring, broaching and sawing.[5]\n Turning operations are operations that rotate the workpiece as the primary method of moving metal against the cutting tool. Lathes are the principal machine tool used in turning. Milling operations are operations in which the cutting tool rotates to bring cutting edges to bear against the workpiece. Milling machines are the principal machine tool used in milling. Drilling operations are operations in which holes are produced or refined by bringing a rotating cutter with cutting edges at the lower extremity into contact with the workpiece. Drilling operations are done primarily in drill presses but sometimes on lathes or mills. Miscellaneous operations are operations that strictly speaking may not be machining operations in that they may not be swarf producing operations but these operations are performed at a typical machine tool. Burnishing is an example of a miscellaneous operation. Burnishing produces no swarf but can be performed at a lathe, mill, or drill press.  An unfinished workpiece requiring machining will need to have some material cut away to create a finished product. A finished product would be a workpiece that meets the specifications set out for that workpiece by engineering drawings or blueprints. For example, a workpiece may be required to have a specific outside diameter. A lathe is a machine tool that can be used to create that diameter by rotating a metal workpiece, so that a cutting tool can cut metal away, creating a smooth, round surface matching the required diameter and surface finish. A drill can be used to remove metal in the shape of a cylindrical hole. Other tools that may be used for various types of metal removal are milling machines, saws, and grinding machines. Many of these same techniques are used in woodworking.\nMore recent, advanced machining techniques include precision CNC machining, electrical discharge machining (EDM), electro-chemical erosion, laser cutting, or water jet cutting to shape metal workpieces.[6]\nAs a commercial venture, machining is generally performed in a machine shop, which consists of one or more workrooms containing major machine tools. Although a machine shop can be a stand-alone operation, many businesses maintain internal machine shops which support specialized needs of the business.\nMachining requires attention to many details for a workpiece to meet the specifications set out in the engineering drawings or blueprints. Beside the obvious problems related to correct dimensions, there is the problem of achieving the correct finish or surface smoothness on the workpiece. The inferior finish found on the machined surface of a workpiece may be caused by incorrect clamping, a dull tool, or inappropriate presentation of a tool. Frequently, this poor surface finish, known as chatter, is evident by an undulating or irregular finish, and the appearance of waves on the machined surfaces of the workpiece.\nContent from wikipedia\n","tags":["manufacturing"],"title":"Our Manufacturing Process Part II","url":"/GitHubPagesRebuild/blog/process-2/"},{"content":"Machining is any of various processes in which a piece of raw material is cut into a desired final shape and size by a controlled material-removal process. The processes that have this common theme, controlled material removal, are today collectively known as subtractive manufacturing,[1] in distinction from processes of controlled material addition, which are known as additive manufacturing. Exactly what the \u0026ldquo;controlled\u0026rdquo; part of the definition implies can vary, but it almost always implies the use of machine tools (in addition to just power tools and hand tools).\nWe make over 200 shapes, the most popular of these include:\n   Shape Design Description Links     Line \u0026ndash; Two pointy ends and a straight stretch of ink Line on wikipedia   Circle ‚Éù A full round with no corners Circle on wikipedia   Triangle ‚ñ≥ Three lines with three corners Triangle on wikipedia    Machining is a part of the manufacture of many metal products, but it can also be used on materials such as wood, plastic, ceramic, and composites.[2] A person who specializes in machining is called a machinist. A room, building, or company where machining is done is called a machine shop. Much of modern-day machining is carried out by computer numerical control (CNC), in which computers are used to control the movement and operation of the mills, lathes, and other cutting machines.\nThe precise meaning of the term machining has evolved over the past one and a half centuries as technology has advanced. In the 18th century, the word machinist simply meant a person who built or repaired machines. This person\u0026rsquo;s work was done mostly by hand, using processes such as the carving of wood and the hand-forging and hand-filing of metal. At the time, millwrights and builders of new kinds of engines (meaning, more or less, machines of any kind), such as James Watt or John Wilkinson, would fit the definition. The noun machine tool and the verb to machine (machined, machining) did not yet exist.\nAround the middle of the 19th century, the latter words were coined as the concepts that they described evolved into widespread existence. Therefore, during the Machine Age, machining referred to (what we today might call) the \u0026ldquo;traditional\u0026rdquo; machining processes, such as turning, boring, drilling, milling, broaching, sawing, shaping, planing, reaming, and tapping.[3] In these \u0026ldquo;traditional\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;conventional\u0026rdquo; machining processes, machine tools, such as lathes, milling machines, drill presses, or others, are used with a sharp cutting tool to remove material to achieve a desired geometry.[4]\nSince the advent of new technologies in the post‚ÄìWorld War II era, such as electrical discharge machining, electrochemical machining, electron beam machining, photochemical machining, and ultrasonic machining, the retronym \u0026ldquo;conventional machining\u0026rdquo; can be used to differentiate those classic technologies from the newer ones. In current usage, the term \u0026ldquo;machining\u0026rdquo; without qualification usually implies the traditional machining processes.\nIn the decades of the 2000s and 2010s, as additive manufacturing (AM) evolved beyond its earlier laboratory and rapid prototyping contexts and began to become common throughout all phases of manufacturing, the term subtractive manufacturing became common retronymously in logical contrast with AM, covering essentially any removal processes also previously covered by the term machining. The two terms are effectively synonymous, although the long-established usage of the term machining continues. This is comparable to the idea that the verb sense of contact evolved because of the proliferation of ways to contact someone (telephone, email, IM, SMS, and so on) but did not entirely replace the earlier terms such as call, talk to, or write to.\nContent from wikipedia.\n","tags":["manufacturing"],"title":"Our Manufacturing Process Part I","url":"/GitHubPagesRebuild/blog/process-1/"},{"content":"","tags":null,"title":"","url":"/GitHubPagesRebuild/editor/"},{"content":"Markdown I am a paragraph in markdown with line wrapping so fit in this width.

Opposite sides of a square are both parallel and equal in length. All four angles of a square are equal. (Each is 360¬∞/4 = 90¬∞, so every angle of a square is a right angle.) All four sides of a square are equal. The diagonals of a square are equal. The square is the n=2 case of the families of n-hypercubes and n-orthoplexes. A square has Schl√§fli symbol. A truncated square, t, is an octagon. An alternated square, h, is a digon.  Other facts  A square can also be defined as a parallelogram with equal diagonals that bisect the angles. If a figure is both a rectangle (right angles) and a rhombus (equal edge lengths), then it is a square. If a circle is circumscribed around a square, the area of the circle is œÄ / 2 (about 1.5708) times the area of the square. If a circle is inscribed in the square, the area of the circle is œÄ / 4 (about 0.7854) times the area of the square. A square has a larger area than any other quadrilateral with the same perimeter. A square tiling is one of three regular tilings of the plane (the others are the equilateral triangle and the regular hexagon). The square is in two families of polytopes in two dimensions: hypercube and the cross-polytope. The square is a highly symmetric object. There are four lines of reflectional symmetry and it has rotational symmetry of order 4 (through 90¬∞, 180¬∞ and 270¬∞). Its symmetry group is the dihedral group D4.

It is the set of all points in a plane that are at a given distance from a given point, the centre; equivalently it is the curve traced out by a point that moves in a plane so that its distance from a given point is constant. The distance between any of the points and the centre is called the radius. This article is about circles in Euclidean geometry, and, in particular, the Euclidean plane, except where otherwise noted.\nA circle is a simple closed curve that divides the plane into two regions: an interior and an exterior. In everyday use, the term \u0026ldquo;circle\u0026rdquo; may be used interchangeably to refer to either the boundary of the figure, or to the whole figure including its interior; in strict technical usage, the circle is only the boundary and the whole figure is called a disc.\nA circle may also be defined as a special kind of ellipse in which the two foci are coincident and the eccentricity is 0, or the two-dimensional shape enclosing the most area per unit perimeter squared, using calculus of variations.\nPrice The circle is priced at  $2 .\nArea The area of a circle is Terminology  Annulus a ring-shaped object, the region bounded by two concentric circles. Arc any connected part of a circle. Specifying two end points of an arc and a center allows for two arcs that together make up a full circle. Centre the point equidistant from all points on the circle. Chord a line segment whose endpoints lie on the circle, thus dividing a circle in two segments. Circumference the length of one circuit along the circle, or the distance around the circle. Diameter a line segment whose endpoints lie on the circle and that passes through the centre; or the length of such a line segment. This is the largest distance between any two points on the circle. It is a special case of a chord, namely the longest chord for a given circle, and its length is twice the length of a radius. Disc the region of the plane bounded by a circle. Lens the region common to (the intersection of) two overlapping discs. Passant a coplanar straight line that has no point in common with the circle. Radius a line segment joining the centre of a circle with any single point on the circle itself; or the length of such a segment, which is half (the length of) a diameter. Sector a region bounded by two radii of equal length with a common center and either of the two possible arcs, determined by this center and the endpoints of the radii. Segment a region bounded by a chord and one of the arcs connecting the chord\u0026rsquo;s endpoints. The length of the chord imposes a lower boundary on the diameter of possible arcs. Sometimes the term segment is used only for regions not containing the center of the circle to which their arc belongs to. Secant an extended chord, a coplanar straight line, intersecting a circle in two points. Semicircle one of the two possible arcs determined by the endpoints of a diameter, taking its midpoint as center. In non-technical common usage it may mean the interior of the two dimensional region bounded by a diameter and one of its arcs, that is technically called a half-disc. A half-disc is a special case of a segment, namely the largest one. Tangent a coplanar straight line that has one single point in common with a circle (\u0026ldquo;touches the circle at this point\u0026rdquo;).  All of the specified regions may be considered as open, that is, not containing their boundaries, or as closed, including their respective boundaries.\nProperties  The circle is the shape with the largest area for a given length of perimeter. (See Isoperimetric inequality.) The circle is a highly symmetric shape: every line through the centre forms a line of reflection symmetry and it has rotational symmetry around the centre for every angle. Its symmetry group is the orthogonal group O(2,R). The group of rotations alone is the circle group T. All circles are similar.  A circle\u0026rsquo;s circumference and radius are proportional. The area enclosed and the square of its radius are proportional. The constants of proportionality are 2œÄ and œÄ, respectively.   The circle that is centred at the origin with radius 1 is called the unit circle.  Thought of as a great circle of the unit sphere, it becomes the Riemannian circle.   Through any three points, not all on the same line, there lies a unique circle. In Cartesian coordinates, it is possible to give explicit formulae for the coordinates of the centre of the circle and the radius in terms of the coordinates of the three given points.

Thus, a curve is a generalization of a line, in that it may be curved.\nIntuitively, a curve may be thought as the trace left by a moving point. This is the definition that appeared, more 2000 years, ago in Euclid\u0026rsquo;s Elements: \u0026ldquo;The [curved] line[a] is [‚Ä¶] the first species of quantity, which has only one dimension, namely length, without any width nor depth, and is nothing else than the flow or run of the point which [‚Ä¶] will leave from its imaginary moving some vestige in length, exempt of any width.\u0026quot;[1]\nThis definition of a curve has been formalized in modern mathematics as: A curve is the image of a continuous function from an interval to a topological space. In some context, the function that defines the curve is called a parametrization, and the curve is a parametric curve. In this article, these curves are sometimes called topological curves for distinguishing them from more constrained curves such as differentiable curves. This definition encompasses most curves that are studied in mathematics; notable exceptions are level curves (which are unions of curves and isolated points), and algebraic curves (see below). Level curves and algebraic curves are sometimes called implicit curves, since they are generally defined by implicit equations.\nNevertheless, the class of topological curves is very broad, and contains some curves that do not look as one may expect for a curve, or even cannot been drawn. This is the case of space-filling curves and fractal curves. For insuring more regularity, the function that defines a curve is often supposed to be differentiable, and the curve is then said a differentiable curve.\nA plane algebraic curve is the zero set of a polynomial in two indeterminates. More generally, an algebraic curve is the zero set of a finite set of polynomials, which satisfies the further condition of being an algebraic variety of dimension one. If the coefficients of the polynomials belong to a field k, the curve is said to be defined over k. In the common case of a real algebraic curve, where k is the field of real numbers, an algebraic curve is a finite union of topological curves. When complex zeros are considered, one has a complex algebraic curve, which, from the topologically point of view, is not a curve, but a surface, and is often called a Riemann surface. Although not being curves in the common sense, algebraic curves defined over other fields have been widely studied. In particular, algebraic curves over a finite field are widely used in modern cryptography.\nContent from wikipedia\n","tags":["shape","product","line"],"title":"Curve","url":"/GitHubPagesRebuild/blog/community/curve/"},{"content":"Last updated August 19, 2019\nThank you for choosing to be part of our community at Acme Corporation‚Ñ¢ (‚ÄúCompany‚Äù, ‚Äúwe‚Äù, ‚Äúus‚Äù, or ‚Äúour‚Äù).

Instruments include graphite pencils, pen and ink, various kinds of paints, inked brushes, colored pencils, crayons, charcoal, chalk, pastels, various kinds of erasers, markers, styluses, and various metals (such as silverpoint). Digital drawing is the act of using a computer to draw. Common methods of digital drawing include a stylus or finger on a touchscreen device, stylus- or finger-to-touchpad, or in some cases, a mouse. There are many digital art programs and devices.\nA drawing instrument releases a small amount of material onto a surface, leaving a visible mark. The most common support for drawing is paper, although other materials, such as cardboard, wood, plastic, leather, canvas, and board, may be used. Temporary drawings may be made on a blackboard or whiteboard or indeed almost anything. The medium has been a popular and fundamental means of public expression throughout human history. It is one of the simplest and most efficient means of communicating visual ideas. The wide availability of drawing instruments makes drawing one of the most common artistic activities.\nIn addition to its more artistic forms, drawing is frequently used in commercial illustration, animation, architecture, engineering and technical drawing. A quick, freehand drawing, usually not intended as a finished work, is sometimes called a sketch. An artist who practices or works in technical drawing may be called a drafter, draftsman or a draughtsman.\nDrawing is one of the oldest forms of human expression within the visual arts. It is generally concerned with the marking of lines and areas of tone onto paper/other material, where the accurate representation of the visual world is expressed upon a plane surface. Traditional drawings were monochrome, or at least had little colour, while modern colored-pencil drawings may approach or cross a boundary between drawing and painting. In Western terminology, drawing is distinct from painting, even though similar media often are employed in both tasks. Dry media, normally associated with drawing, such as chalk, may be used in pastel paintings. Drawing may be done with a liquid medium, applied with brushes or pens. Similar supports likewise can serve both: painting generally involves the application of liquid paint onto prepared canvas or panels, but sometimes an underdrawing is drawn first on that same support.\nDrawing is often exploratory, with considerable emphasis on observation, problem-solving and composition. Drawing is also regularly used in preparation for a painting, further obfuscating their distinction. Drawings created for these purposes are called studies.\nThere are several categories of drawing, including figure drawing, cartooning, doodling, and freehand. There are also many drawing methods, such as line drawing, stippling, shading, the surrealist method of entopic graphomania (in which dots are made at the sites of impurities in a blank sheet of paper, and lines are then made between the dots), and tracing (drawing on a translucent paper, such as tracing paper, around the outline of preexisting shapes that show through the paper).\nA quick, unrefined drawing may be called a sketch.\nIn fields outside art, technical drawings or plans of buildings, machinery, circuitry and other things are often called \u0026ldquo;drawings\u0026rdquo; even when they have been transferred to another medium by printing.\nContent from wikipedia.\n","tags":["shape","style","manufacturing"],"title":"Shaper","url":"/GitHubPagesRebuild/news/shaper/"},{"content":"A license (American English) or licence (British English) is an official permission or permit to do, use, or own something (as well as the document of that permission or permit).\nA license can be granted by a party to another party as an element of an agreement between those parties. A shorthand definition of a license is \u0026ldquo;an authorization to use licensed material.\u0026rdquo;\nIn particular, a license may be issued by authorities, to allow an activity that would otherwise be forbidden. It may require paying a fee or proving a capability. The requirement may also serve to keep the authorities informed on a type of activity, and to give them the opportunity to set conditions and limitations.\nA licensor may grant a license under intellectual property laws to authorize a use (such as copying software or using a (patented) invention) to a licensee, sparing the licensee from a claim of infringement brought by the licensor. A license under intellectual property commonly has several components beyond the grant itself, including a term, territory, renewal provisions, and other limitations deemed vital to the licensor.\nTerm: many licenses are valid for a particular length of time. This protects the licensor should the value of the license increase, or market conditions change. It also preserves enforceability by ensuring that no license extends beyond the term of the agreement.\nTerritory: a license may stipulate what territory the rights pertain to. For example, a license with a territory limited to \u0026ldquo;North America\u0026rdquo; (Mexico/United States/Canada) would not permit a licensee any protection from actions for use in Japan.\nA shorthand definition of license is \u0026ldquo;a promise by the licensor not to sue the licensee\u0026rdquo;. That means without a license any use or exploitation of intellectual property by a third party would amount to copying or infringement. Such copying would be improper and could, by using the legal system, be stopped if the intellectual property owner wanted to do so.\nIntellectual property licensing plays a major role in business, academia and broadcasting. Business practices such as franchising, technology transfer, publication and character merchandising entirely depend on the licensing of intellectual property. Land licensing (proprietary licensing) and IP licensing form sub-branches of law born out of the interplay of general laws of contract and specific principles and statutory laws relating to these respective assets.\nContent from wikipedia.\n","tags":["shape","style","manufacturing"],"title":"Square License","url":"/GitHubPagesRebuild/news/square-license/"},{"content":"","tags":null,"title":"Template Page","url":"/GitHubPagesRebuild/template/"},{"content":"Terms By accessing the website for Acme Corporation, you are agreeing to be bound by these terms of service, all applicable laws and regulations, and agree that you are responsible for compliance with any applicable local laws.

It is one of the basic shapes in geometry. A triangle with vertices A, B, and C is denoted ‚ñ≥ ABC.\nIn Euclidean geometry any three points, when non-collinear, determine a unique triangle and simultaneously, a unique plane (i.e. a two-dimensional Euclidean space). In other words, there is only one plane that contains that triangle, and every triangle is contained in some plane. If the entire geometry is only the Euclidean plane, there is only one plane and all triangles are contained in it; however, in higher-dimensional Euclidean spaces, this is no longer true. This article is about triangles in Euclidean geometry, and in particular, the Euclidean plane, except where otherwise noted.\nTypes of triangles By lengths of sides Triangles can be classified according to the lengths of their sides:\n An equilateral triangle has all sides the same length. An equilateral triangle is also a regular polygon with all angles measuring 60¬∞. An isosceles triangle has two sides of equal length. An isosceles triangle also has two angles of the same measure, namely the angles opposite to the two sides of the same length; this fact is the content of the isosceles triangle theorem, which was known by Euclid. Some mathematicians define an isosceles triangle to have exactly two equal sides, whereas others define an isosceles triangle as one with at least two equal sides. The latter definition would make all equilateral triangles isosceles triangles. The 45‚Äì45‚Äì90 right triangle, which appears in the tetrakis square tiling, is isosceles. A scalene triangle has all its sides of different lengths. Equivalently, it has all angles of different measure.  Hatch marks, also called tick marks, are used in diagrams of triangles and other geometric figures to identify sides of equal lengths. A side can be marked with a pattern of \u0026ldquo;ticks\u0026rdquo;, short line segments in the form of tally marks; two sides have equal lengths if they are both marked with the same pattern. In a triangle, the pattern is usually no more than 3 ticks. An equilateral triangle has the same pattern on all 3 sides, an isosceles triangle has the same pattern on just 2 sides, and a scalene triangle has different patterns on all sides since no sides are equal. Similarly, patterns of 1, 2, or 3 concentric arcs inside the angles are used to indicate equal angles. An equilateral triangle has the same pattern on all 3 angles, an isosceles triangle has the same pattern on just 2 angles, and a scalene triangle has different patterns on all angles since no angles are equal.\nBy internal angles Triangles can also be classified according to their internal angles, measured here in degrees.\n A right triangle (or right-angled triangle, formerly called a rectangled triangle) has one of its interior angles measuring 90¬∞ (a right angle). The side opposite to the right angle is the hypotenuse, the longest side of the triangle. The other two sides are called the legs or catheti (singular: cathetus) of the triangle. Right triangles obey the Pythagorean theorem: the sum of the squares of the lengths of the two legs is equal to the square of the length of the hypotenuse: a2 + b2 = c2, where a and b are the lengths of the legs and c is the length of the hypotenuse. Special right triangles are right triangles with additional properties that make calculations involving them easier. One of the two most famous is the 3‚Äì4‚Äì5 right triangle, where 32 + 42 = 52. In this situation, 3, 4, and 5 are a Pythagorean triple. The other one is an isosceles triangle that has 2 angles that each measure 45 degrees. Triangles that do not have an angle measuring 90¬∞ are called oblique triangles. A triangle with all interior angles measuring less than 90¬∞ is an acute triangle or acute-angled triangle. If c is the length of the longest side, then a2 + b2 \u0026gt; c2, where a and b are the lengths of the other sides. A triangle with one interior angle measuring more than 90¬∞ is an obtuse triangle or obtuse-angled triangle. If c is the length of the longest side, then a2 + b2 \u0026lt; c2, where a and b are the lengths of the other sides. A triangle with an interior angle of 180¬∞ (and collinear vertices) is degenerate. A right degenerate triangle has collinear vertices, two of which are coincident.
